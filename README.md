# Rofi Menu with Categories

To use this menu, put the config file and the rasi file in ~/.config/rofi/. Then use the shell script to open the menu. If you want to customize the menu, change the values in the .rasi file for the colors / shape and edit the .config file to add / remove items and categories.

I did not make the original shell script for this project, it is a modified version of what I found on github. If you made the original script, please contact me at u/Nybu_ so I can credit you.
